# Sean OS Build Status

This file is the visible progress ledger for the automated Sean OS builder.
Every automation run updates it, even when no notification is sent.

## Current snapshot

- Last continuous-goal checkpoint started: 2026-08-20 17:25 EDT
- Last continuous-goal checkpoint completed: 2026-08-20 17:29 EDT
- Milestone selected: primary operator workflow for alert delivery
- Run state: Completed; scheduled builder paused and continuous goal active
- Last meaningful milestone: restart-safe primary operator workflow for alert delivery
- Deployed commit: `1aa8762`
- Runtime: Online, private, one replica, persistent volume attached
- Concrete changes: added scoped outbox review/staging, idempotent bounded approval
  requests, separately authenticated decision/authorization routes, expiry handling,
  secret rejection, exact-delivery tamper protection, and in-memory HTTP contract proof
- Verification: 110 tests passed; schema-v10 release and recovery gates passed
- Real data connected: No
- Live integrations enabled: No
- Current blocker: executing the production drill or delivering an alert requires
  Sean's separate exact approval; neither is needed for continued local development
- Next milestone: add restart-safe worker processing for authorized synthetic outbox
  items, with bounded claims and retries; retain an absolute no-network/live-mode gate
- Sean action required: No

## Recent verified milestones

1. IAC-owned repository and private Railway service established.
2. Persistent SQLite volume mounted at `/data` and verified across restart.
3. GitHub App restricted to `oohdas/iac-ai-runtime`.
4. Railway production branch connected to `main`; automatic deployment verified.
5. Synthetic kill-switch drill added with audit and recovery evidence.
6. Deterministic monitoring covers integrity, kill-switch, worker, queue, approval,
   budget, and backup escalation classes without sending alerts.
7. Alert routing now fails closed across ownership scopes, filters by severity, and
   produces approval-gated plans only; the production drill has explicit pass/abort criteria.
8. Alert plans now deduplicate deterministically and generate hashed, timezone-aware
   acknowledgement evidence without authorizing delivery.
9. Schema v8 durably stores scoped alert observations, counts repeats, and permits
   one immutable Sean-only acknowledgement while preserving audit evidence.
10. The monitoring CLI can now persist deduplicated observations only when a complete,
    scope-owned, non-secret route contract is supplied; it still cannot deliver alerts.
11. A supervisor-friendly monitoring loop now runs at bounded cadence, exits cleanly
    on signals, fails visibly, and remains an optional non-deployed local process.
12. The existing worker can now run monitoring at monotonic cadence inside its one
    process; default startup remains unchanged and complete-contract tests prove no delivery.
13. The container accepts a default-off monitoring environment contract that aborts
    startup on partial, malformed, unsafe, or unbounded values; Railway is unchanged.
14. Schema v9 groups observations into durable scoped incidents, supports Sean-only
    resolution, and reopens recurring conditions without losing historical evidence.
15. Daily and weekly reports now rank active incidents, show incident deltas, exclude
    resolved incidents, and prevent health/queue/budget leakage across scopes.
16. The primary interface now queries active IAC incidents and resolves them only with
    a distinct Sean operator credential; identical replay is safe and changed evidence fails.
17. Schema v10 now stages one delivery per incident generation, atomically consumes
    exact scope-matched approval, and accepts only deterministic no-network receipts.
18. The primary interface now reviews/stages deliveries, requests bounded approval,
    and keeps Sean's decision and exact authorization as separate recoverable steps.

## Update contract

Each automated run must record:

- run timestamp;
- milestone selected;
- files or behavior changed;
- tests and checks run;
- blockers or approvals required;
- next milestone;
- whether Sean must act.

The ledger never contains credentials, real personal/IAC records, or secret values.
